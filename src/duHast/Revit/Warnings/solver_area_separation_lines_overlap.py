    A solver that addresses overlapping area separation lines in a Revit model.
    It can delete or modify these lines to resolve the overlap issue.

    Example Usage:

    print(result.status)
    print(result.message)

    Main functionalities:
    - Solving overlapping area separation lines by deleting or modifying them.
    - Ignoring area separation lines that overlap when they are in group instances.
