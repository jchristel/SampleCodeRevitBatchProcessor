~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Family Base data analysis module containing functions to find circular family referencing in extracted data.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A circular reference is when a family A has a family B nested but family B has also family A nested.

Algorithm description:

- read base data file processing list (created by RevitFamilyBaseDataProcessor module)
- extract all root families (no ' :: ' in root path)
- extract all nested families (' :: 'in root path)

- loop over root families
    - loop over nested families 
        - check if root family is in nested family root path
            - yes
            - get all families higher in root path and add to parents prop of root family (if not there already)
            - get all families lower in root path of nested family and add to child property of root family if not already
            -   TODO: Check this theory: families always have the same children...once children are identified there is no need to check over and over again!

- loop over root family 
    -   check whether any family exist in parent and child family
        - YES: found circular reference
