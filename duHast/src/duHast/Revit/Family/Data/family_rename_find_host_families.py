Finds host families of nested families requiring to be renamed.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- read file rename change list:
-   text file (tab separated) with columns: currentFamilyName   currentFamilyFilePath	categoryName newFamilyName
-   note: current family file path could be blank in situations where just a rename of a nested family is required...
- read base data file processing list (created by RevitFamilyBaseDataProcessor module)
- extract all root families (no :: in root path)
- extract all nested families ( :: in root path)
- loop over nested families and find any family where:
    - family at first nesting level is in rename list by name and category
    - extract root family name and add to identified host family list

- loop over root families
-   find match in identified host families
- write out root family date: family file path, family name, category
