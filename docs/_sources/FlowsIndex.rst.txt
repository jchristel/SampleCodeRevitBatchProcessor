Flows
---------------------------

Flows are Python modules which use the functions provided in the sample library and the Revit Batch Processor to solve a particular task.
They can be as simple as a single module which can be run using the GUI version of Revit Batch Processor only, or, on the other end of the spectrum, can be made up of a number of modules which are run in parallel through batch or powershell scripts.
