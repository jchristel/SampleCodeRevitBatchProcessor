    This may be required because a solid can be made up of multiple volumes (extrusion, sweeps etc)
    Turns out a solid returns a single face for multiple sketches. In order to work out whether these are multiple non overlapping polygons I will need to check
    whether a point from one polygon is within the other if so it may represents a hole or an island within a hole...to avoid misreading an island for a whole I will need to sort the faces by area
    and check from largest down to smallest.
    Also poly lines send back will always only represent: first list: exterior boundary as polygon any follow list is a hole within the polygon. Any islands in those holes will get their own top level representation
    i.e. no further list nesting!
    Within the faces groups: identify faces which are horizontal: its normal is facing up or down
    select the face with the lower Z coordinates and
    group all edges of the above face which form a closed loop (first loop of edges to describe the extend of that face, any secondary loops define holes in face)
