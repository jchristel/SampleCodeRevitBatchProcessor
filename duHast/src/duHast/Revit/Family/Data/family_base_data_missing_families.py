Family Base data analysis module containing functions to find missing families.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A missing family is a family which is not present in the family base data report as a root family but present as a nested family.

Algorithm description:

- read base data file processing list (created by RevitFamilyBaseDataProcessor module)
- extract all root families (no :: in root path)
- extract all nested families ( :: in root path)

- cull nested family so each nested family appears only once

- loop over nested families
    - loop over root families 
        - check if nested family exists in root families ( by name and category)
            - no
            - add to missing families list
            - stop processing since one match is enough per missing family
- write out missing families data ( host family filepath,)
