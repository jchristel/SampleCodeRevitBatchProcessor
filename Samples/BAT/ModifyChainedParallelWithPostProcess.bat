:: this sample demonstrates how to:
:: - run 2 different task (Alpha and Beta) where each task itself is executed in 2 parallel running sessions (session 1 and 2) of batchprocessor
::    - session 1 and 2 use two different settings files where the only difference between them is the task file list. All other settings are identical.
:: - task Beta is dependent on task Alpha to finish first before it can start
:: - run a post process script outside of the revit environment which will only start off after all task Beta sessions have finished processing  

:: based on stack overflow scripts:
