Helper functions to rename family files on a local or network drive.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This helper function expect a folder containing rename directive files. For format of those files refer to module RevitFamilyRenameFilesUtils

Note:

- The revit category is not used when renaming files but when renaming nested families.
- Any associated type catalogue files will also be renamed to match the new family name.
- Rename directives may not have the filePath property set if the directive is only meant to be used on loaded families.
