_settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two settings files in this directory. One for each session of Revit Batch Processor started in the flow.

- BatchRvt.2022.AddModelRevisionOneA.Settings.json
- BatchRvt.2022.AddModelRevisionOneB.Settings.json

The only difference between those two settings files is the task file specified in them.
