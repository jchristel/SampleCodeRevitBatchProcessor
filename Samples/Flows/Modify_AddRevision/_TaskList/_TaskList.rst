_TaskList
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This directory contains two task lists. One for each session of Revit Batch Processor started in the flow.

- Tasklist_0.txt
- Tasklist_1.txt

These files are populated by the Pre_AddRevision.py script:

- Files are fairly evenly distributed across the two task list files depending on their file size.
- If only one file is to be processed, Tasklist_1.txt will be empty.
