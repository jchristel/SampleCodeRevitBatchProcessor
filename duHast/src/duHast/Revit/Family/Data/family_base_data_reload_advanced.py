Family Base data analysis module containing functions to build a reload tree.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- read change list:
-   text file (tab separated) with columns:familyName	familyFilePath	categoryName
- read overall family base data list
- get direct parents of change list families
- get next level parents of direct parents

- loop direct parent list until empty:
-   - remove any direct parents which also exist in next level parents
-   - write direct parents to file
-   - set next level parents as direct parents
-   - find all direct parents of changed families in base data list

- those reload lists will then be separated into work chunks by file list writer...
